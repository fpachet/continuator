# A Python implementation of a constrainable Continuator

A reimplementation of the Continuator system, using a combination of variable-order Markov model and belief propagation to enforce positional constraints.
Note that this is the only system, to my knowledge, able to produce controllable sequences (with guarantees) with unary/positional constraints.
These are extremely powerful and can turn seemingly "random" walks into actual music with intention.

It is inspired from on the following papers:
- Pachet, F. The Continuator: Musical Interaction with Style. Journal of New Music Research, 32(3):333-341, 2003
- Papadopoulos, A., Pachet, F., Roy, P. and Sakellariou, J. Exact Sampling for Regular and Markov Constraints with Belief Propagation. 21th Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming Conference (CP 2015), Cork (Ireland), 2015

## Features

- Efficient but simple implementation of variable-order markov model
- Use of a viewpoint system that enables the handling of rhythmic structure without the cost of heavy tokenization
- Sampling is a combination of Markov with a belief propagation system that enforce positional constraints (that are duly retro propagated)
- Many tricks here and there to maximize musical quality

### Dependencies

The project requires the following Python packages:
numpy~=2.2.3
mido~=1.2.10

## Installation
clone the repository: git@github.com:fpachet/continuator.git
cd continuator, then install with pip install
launch:
> python3 core.ctor.app.py

## Usage

```python
from core.ctor.continuator_4 import Continuator2

# Initialize the model
midi_file_path = "../../data/prelude_c.mid"
generator = Continuator2(midi_file_path, 4, transposition=False)

# set positional constraints as a dictionary index -> viewpoint
constraints = {}
# to start with a "start"
# constraints[0] = generator.get_start_vp()
# to force arbitrary value at arbitrary position, here a D3 as first note
constraints[0] = generator.get_vp_for_pitch(62)
# to end with an "end"
constraints[19] = generator.get_end_vp()

# generate the viewpoint sequence with some length
generated_sequence = generator.sample_sequence(length=20, constraints=constraints)

# remove extra start or end viewpoint if needed
sequence_to_render = generated_sequence[0:-1]

# realize the sequence with actual notes
rendered_sequence = generator.realize_vp_sequence(sequence_to_render)

# save the generated sequence
generator.save_midi(rendered_sequence, "../../data/constrained_prelude.mid", tempo=-1)
```

## User interface
Currently continuator can be run as:
- python code on midi files (input and output)
- real time midi with rt-midi on a local machine, command line
- real time midi with rt-midi on a local machine, with a gradio interface from a browser

A web client-server version will be available soon, as so far attempts at using gradio and javascript failed.
